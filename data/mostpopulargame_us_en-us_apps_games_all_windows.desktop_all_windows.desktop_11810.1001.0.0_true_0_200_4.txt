On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit.

It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance. It gets stressful and exciting, especially when things get closer to the endgame. \r\n\r\nYou better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Sometimes staying in jail can be the safest place to be, but only after your properties are primed to make you money.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to buy, sell and negotiate to win. Everyone loves the timeless game-play of Onopoly. \r\n\r\nTry to win the onopoly game by buying all the property and collecting as much money as possible. \r\nWill you be able to defeat your opponents? \r\n\r\nDownload Onopoly for free!!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Onopoly Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Create Private Room and Invite Friends and Family\r\n✔ True multiplayer where you can play with real people online in online multiplayer mode.\r\n✔ Adaptable intelligence with smart AI when playing against computer\r\n✔ Play with players across the world\r\n✔ 2, 3,4,5 or 6 Player Mode \r\n✔ Play with Local Multiplayer\r\n \r\nPlease don't forget to Rate and Review Onopoly! \r\n\r\nYour Reviews Matter!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PBF1JSFR4PZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Color Road 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35577.14124814654910940.ae1b2e14-a839-436c-876e-b390a111494c.a5121afe-ecb0-4b47-9011-6f5ba713ca8d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13468.14124814654910940.ae1b2e14-a839-436c-876e-b390a111494c.6754905c-a32f-4d96-851c-36019603d07e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35577.14124814654910940.ae1b2e14-a839-436c-876e-b390a111494c.a5121afe-ecb0-4b47-9011-6f5ba713ca8d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"92","PackageFamilyNames":["11821FreeMagicSagaGames.ColorRoad3D_7tgwfwz4aj24y"],"ContentIds":["ffcead58-e702-8603-1c12-54cbc7268763","acc8a83b-c664-cf1d-4b5e-88a22b14b25a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Color Road is the colorful race.

Secret of Serpent Creek is an original hidden-object puzzle-adventure game, featuring a totally unique Detective Mode. This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode! What’s more, she will crack codes, pick locks and solve clever puzzles along the way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CLL1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Queen's Quest: Tower of Darkness (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11482.13510798886624746.8ace81af-e4a8-4535-a97c-58c518e9d6fd.635dd235-0ba4-446f-be0e-1043ea955642","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"135","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.QueensQuestTowerofDarknessFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["966ec0de-5937-4d3c-4464-5399d4e49f4a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nDefeat the sorcerer and save the royal heir in a story inspired by one of the Grimms' Fairy Tales!  \r\n\r\nQueen's Quest: Tower of Darkness is an exciting adventure game inspired by one of the Grimms' Fairy Tales, taking place in a faraway realm full of magic, wonders and otherworldly creatures.\r\nThe idyllic life of the royal heiress and her husband is shattered when a demonic sorcerer arrives at their palace to kidnap their newborn daughter.\r\nMagnus, the godfather, saves our heroine with his magic, but Prince Henrik gets turned into stone, while the intruder escapes with the royal heir.\r\nWho is the sorcerer?

It's hard to discover what makes rolling those dice over and over again so fun, but it's beyond delight when you finally see those sixes line up. \r\n\r\nYahtzee is a simple brain game that trains analytical thinking. It's a classic board dice game.\r\nThe objective of Yahtzee is to score the highest possible score within the 13 rounds of the game. Players roll five dice in order to make the desired combinations, which have different fixed or variable point values. The results of each turn are recorded on a special score sheet.\r\n\r\nYahtzee is played with five dice. This popular game, lasts for 13 rounds as the players roll the dice and attempt to complete various combinations. The rules of Yahtzee are simple, and the game remains popular among people of all ages. Simply roll the dice, make your choices and score some points. At the end of the 13 turns, the player with the highest point total wins the game\r\nDo the best dice combination in the this multiplayer Yahtzee pro game. Half of the fun of this game is to yell out the game's name if and when you roll one. A Yahtzee occurs when a player rolls and all five dice are the same number. Rolling five \"sixes\" is the best roll in the game. \r\n\r\nSpecial Yahtzee rule is, the first time you get a yahtzee in a game it is worth 50 points (if you use it in the yahtzee slot). If you roll another yahtzee after you have already got the 50 points (i.e., you didn’t take a zero), you will get a 100 point bonus.\r\n\r\nThe Yahtzee scorecard or sheet contains 13 scoring boxes divided between two sections: \r\n1) Upper section \r\n2) Lower section\r\n\r\nIt is a game of great chance, luck and also of smart thinking and strategy.

Whilst simple in concept a good deal of strategy is required to complete the layouts.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from a layout in the least possible time. Layouts can vary in pattern, size and shape. Tiles are removed in pairs and may only be removed if they are both free and match one another. Free tiles are ones that have no other piece touching the left, right or both sides and no tiles on top.\r\n\r\nWhilst all deals generated by Mahjongg are solvable you will need to remove pairs of tiles carefully to ensure you don’t stop the removal of remaining pairs. \r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

You’ve just found the most original coin dozer casino simulator that blends perfectly with your world explorer and treasure hunting games taste! Our unique arcade provides not only the classic coin dropper gameplay, but it mixes it with a treasure hunt for giving you a unique coin dozer experience in different level locations like: Treasure Cave, Gold of Ra, Diamond Rock & Temple of Venus!\r\n\r\nThe infamous red-bearded pirate left behind his treasure maps!  It seems like your luck already started changing because now, you have all the treasures locations. Begin your treasure hunt quest now, to collect all the coins & prizes of the huge lots inside the chests. Be careful though; the red-bearded pirate left some traps & fake treasure chests to keep safe his gold coins & jewels. The traps can cause that most of the coins and goodies fall to the sides of the dozer machine; so be really careful when you tap!\r\n\r\n💰🔦💰 Let the treasures chase & the coin dash dozer fun action begins! Download NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest and enjoy the tons of prizes & high winning rates! 💰🔦💰\r\n\r\nNot familiar with Coin Dozer free games rules? No problem! It works almost the same like the real coin pusher games machines, and you’ll see a short video tutorial. Tap the pusher to make coins drop on it. All the coins or prizes that fall on the sides won’t be counted on your balance. The main goal is to drop coins & have them pushing over the front edge of the platforms. Our game includes incredible boosters that will help you on your cash collect quest. Check every booster special power & actions in the help section to build your winner strategy! Use the power ups wisely, as some of them don’t regenerate so fast as others. Gain XP points to increase your experience bar and unlock more maps and game levels. Our dozer can compete with the best prize claw machines or simulators in rewards matter; but unlike the claw machine, your chances of winning are much higher!\r\n\r\n🎊💀🎊 Collect all the special items like gold bars or secret boxes to conquer all the secret rewards hidden among the chests treasures! Try NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest FREE for limited time only! 🎊💀🎊\r\n\r\nIf you get stuck, use the Shake option; every collected coin fills your Shake meter. You can activate it when it reaches one of the three levels: Low, Medium or High. Activating this feature shakes the table making the coins on the edge fall off the table. Collect 4 or more coins at once to trigger a Coin Attack; this will create and spread special goodies, prizes and puzzle pieces. Once you collect all the gold puzzle pieces, 12 to be exact, you’ll open the secret door of the room which contains a huge amount of rewards. Puzzle mini games unlock at level 5, and from there each level of our dozer has a puzzle mini-game to solve. Keep gaining XP to collect all the surprise rewards waiting for you!\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3TFH0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Can You Escape - Island","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.30580.13510798884696985.174d1032-9bbd-426f-84e0-279c9100cb55.49796d98-d47b-4972-9f42-c77d10b1987a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.31331.13510798884696985.f1dfd96e-6a40-465c-ad24-05e5ee1f773a.b374450a-0200-4daa-971a-bb28d04486ec","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6308.13510798884696985.d1ab437d-42d4-4011-8122-cb793c3019dc.dadd0cfd-dcf9-42bd-be95-ae1e05b42052","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6041.13510798884696985.0ac01fa5-b047-4708-a6ae-d9c77d4d3d9d.5f4c8e4c-044a-4ba7-9039-a8629387d4c1","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25028.13510798884696985.7614361d-6714-423c-b642-a86b1d62592d.28192496-ff20-4075-9040-5265f8ab2800","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13794.13510798884696985.e3511d40-a58f-4e3c-b71d-c2c75cc86a5d.92f2dde2-0ae6-4441-8e77-6cd72f066e07","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.31638.13510798884696985.a5c5ead9-6ee3-4d1f-b761-49e1c607ef3c.1f826f8e-358b-4c0e-84ae-d626d5275fe1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46227.13510798884696985.ebecc18e-236f-44b2-a152-4584200a01e7.7c70e2ac-4033-4873-a41d-6fc70d5a1c96","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25807.13510798884696985.d79e7d7f-b6a2-4aa9-bc21-5504c7dbac69.10ad80fd-affb-4320-be59-9b9313d55c2a","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15076.13510798884696985.e1fcf600-fa53-4352-96b2-0a7fc8cd2713.639419ac-76ee-4502-9665-36a228f5807d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"238","PackageFamilyNames":["Trapped.CanYouEscape-Island_bhn6e84ggqs1p"],"ContentIds":["a2d7316e-a630-2074-8a88-3f9cf29328a8","10862224-1f3b-d686-9e6e-5381a04d30c4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you think that this island is deserted, then you are mistaken.\r\nYou were thrown on the island shore after surviving a terrible shipwreck.

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets. \r\n\r\nIt's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nElevator-Scale VR\r\nFloor Plan: Hands-On Edition adds full support for motion controllers to the original game. Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.\r\n\r\nPlay Your Way\r\nFigure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nFloor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete. We've priced it accordingly, and think it has enough special moments to be memorable and something you'll want to share with friends. Thanks for checking it out!\r\n\r\nYou can reach the developers on Twitter at

Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.\r\n\r\nSTEALTH\r\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isn’t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.\r\n\r\nLOAD-OUTS & GEAR\r\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and there’s something for everyone.

The game is played with a standard deck of cards (including 2 jokers). \r\n\r\nPlayers are dealt a total of 12 cards.  The remaining 6 cards are dealt face down into the 'Kitty'.  Each player will bid starting clockwise from the dealer (dealer bids last).  \r\nThe bid consists of a bid number and description.  The bid number is the number of tricks (books) a player believes his partnership can achieve over 6. For example, a bid of 4 = 10 books. \r\n\r\nThe bid description indicates a bid direction (High or Low) or whether the bid is a 'No' trump. A bid direction of High (Uptown) indicates A,K,Q... are the highest value cards. A bid direction of Low (Downtown, Special) indicates A,2,3... are the highest value cards. A 'No' trump bid indicates that each suit has equal weight and the lead card can not be 'cut'.  The bid direction of a 'No' bid is specified after winning the bid.\r\nBid numbers can range from 3 - 7.  The Option screen gives the player the option of playing with a minimum of 3 or 4.\r\nBid descriptions have the following weights:  'No' > 'Low' > 'High'.  The Option screen allows the player to play make 'Low' and 'High' equal in weight: 'No' > 'Low' = 'High'. \r\n\r\nThe highest bidder indicates a 'trump' suit or in the case of a 'No' bid indicates the direction (High/Low).  The jokers become the highest value cards in the indicated 'trump' suit.  For example, if Diamonds were called as 'trump' the highest value cards for a 'High' direction would be:  Big Joker, Little Joker, A, K,...  In the case of a 'No' bid, the Big Joker and Little Joker have no value and should be discarded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe bid winner will start play as the lead player.  The remaining players must play a card in the same suit as the lead card if available. If the player does not have a card in that suit they may play another suit. The highest value card in the lead suit wins the sequence unless a trump card is played in which case the highest trump card wins the sequence. The winner of the sequence will be the lead player in the following sequence. \r\n\r\nGame Options\r\n\r\nPractice Mode:  The computer will not bid.  Allowing the player to always win bid and practice different plays.\r\nScoring - Conventional and Progressive:  With Conventional scoring the bid winner may go into negatives if the bid is not acheived.  Progressive scoring will award points to the opposition team if the bid is not achieved.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NVS9K44SRF0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hair salon for girls","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57618.14393086368025669.4636a2aa-8c40-4258-83b1-6d16df30f3d8.473fd0bc-7d35-457a-bc2c-b9fd9f48ac43","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34057.14393086368025669.c78ef946-09db-4b93-9204-aceb029c6073.21f8551a-b3f6-4e53-b27f-8beea3eb2b0d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"184","PackageFamilyNames":["35237JoyJourney.Hairsalonforgirls_rqmgvvvsy2kse"],"ContentIds":["604e2a8f-9d99-a3ac-b6f8-cc22b83b17ef"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most beautiful and exciting hair salon games, Magic Hair Salon is coming now!

As you may know, most Solitaire games are not winnable, despite playing your best. We decided to fix that and provide you with the best game experience. We included in this game only winnable deals for both types of games: games in which you draw one card, and games in which you draw 3 cards. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly.\r\nDownload and play now! \r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ 100.000+ Solvable deals \r\n✓ Draw 1 or Draw 3 cards option\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Easy to use \r\n✓ High quality graphics\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ In this game you have to build up 4 stacks of cards of the same suit in each of the 4 foundation piles from the top of the screen. Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n✓ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n✓ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the game. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n✓ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and was the direct cause of the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again. \r\n\r\nMagic Age 1053\r\nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun, the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back. \r\nIt starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde.

You can casually play 4-5 levels a day for when you're in a bus or in a line. But if you are more competitive, you can set your goals much higher. You can even compete with people around the world and be the first to complete all 10,000 levels. You can check the online leaderboards after each level you complete to see where you stand in the world.\r\nIt might start easy at first. Anyone might be able to win the first 10 levels. But those are just for warm up. As you progress the levels will become extremely challenging. Then, to progress further, you will have to rethink your choices more than once. Ready for this epic challenge? Start playing now!\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Why should I play ***\r\n\r\n★ Easy to play: Just tap on the pairs that add up to 13\r\n★ Levels are short and relaxing. Also good for 1 minute breaks. \r\n★ 10,000 winnable levels that guarantee you thousands of hours of relaxing fun;\r\n★ Advanced Hint option and Undo to help you make even better choices along the way;\r\n★ 4 different card styles to fit your preferences and for better seeing;\r\n★ 5 background styles;\r\n★ Natural animations, beautiful graphics and a very intuitive interface;\r\n★ For the more avid players, take notice: Even if you play 10 minutes a day, you will still need 3+ years to complete all levels ;) . \r\n\r\n\r\n*** How to play ***\r\n\r\n- The goal of the game is to clear as many boards as possible by tapping any two cards that add up to exactly 13. For example, you can tap a 10 and a 3, or an 8 and a 5. Aces count as 1, Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12 and Kings count as 13.\r\n- You can tap away the king with just one move. To eliminate a queen, you need to match it with an ace.\r\n- You can match any uncovered card. \r\n- If there are no more available matches, press \"Draw\" to draw cards from the deck below. You can draw the entire stack three times over. \r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.
