Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N3JHVHCJB82","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"SWAT and Zombies - Metal Soldiers VS Zombie","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36343.13935803223332877.27a7daed-c8aa-4a0d-ac5a-746b40c0f0e6.30c1aa97-24b6-4c30-b0a1-f31215fb836a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27565.13935803223332877.27a7daed-c8aa-4a0d-ac5a-746b40c0f0e6.6511b66a-c692-4205-9a98-203aec795c52","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51299.13935803223332877.27a7daed-c8aa-4a0d-ac5a-746b40c0f0e6.96945bb8-8ddb-40d6-8f23-727e19c886c1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51299.13935803223332877.27a7daed-c8aa-4a0d-ac5a-746b40c0f0e6.96945bb8-8ddb-40d6-8f23-727e19c886c1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1f1f1f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14765.13935803223332877.27a7daed-c8aa-4a0d-ac5a-746b40c0f0e6.29c7e796-f1b0-4ee6-bf6d-d3164085b928","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33611.13935803223332877.27a7daed-c8aa-4a0d-ac5a-746b40c0f0e6.49d75369-3ae6-440d-b734-f5be71d2fa5f","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["8533SmartGamesProMX.SWATandZombies-MetalSoldiersVS_5m91jtwxk93h0"],"ContentIds":["a724a2c4-cce0-4176-f509-e3ce43ca6301","b95aa711-597d-3893-6b4b-e191a8c6b339"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,HoloLens,Mobil","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The defense game SWAT and Zombies - Metal Soldiers VS Zombie is avialable on the store\r\n- Kill or be killed!

The rain was pouring down and lightning was striking the trees & mountains outside. Foster thought about his battalion and wondered where they are – the weather had made him loose his tracks. He tried to make plans to go out as soon as the weather gets better and regroup with his men and find his way out in this unknown valley.\r\n\r\nThe morning light brought with it calmness to the weather. It was still raining but it was possible to go out and look for his men and hunt for some food.\r\n\r\nIt is time to load up your sniper rifle and jump into the wilds. Play the role of Captain Foster and help him feed himself.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5G47V","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Simple Minesweeper","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51956.13510798887052059.4f8294a7-8ec2-4b03-ad68-2450442c6d99.991ca0b9-772f-4710-86d2-36f81623c747","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43651.13510798887052059.1cd08988-e59d-4668-9dd2-37410d241ef1.b54c414d-6b75-48ac-bf28-c613c0c1303a","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24342.13510798887052059.b701bd87-5a1e-4796-8eed-170b35804de4.91e6b03b-ee25-4125-8400-2a4b8201d1d0","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63296.13510798887052059.158b55e3-7adc-422a-a688-7f699c5dcc64.9498fb9b-255a-4a17-9817-aa2412f0644f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29300.13510798887052059.f6b6f1a5-a476-4184-8d26-fe8d9d182462.25d2078e-07e2-4e2e-8cd4-ce192c093878","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10917.13510798887052059.116cf9bd-41e1-4b00-9d93-bef7dccb5094.6a9cf4e1-fcab-46b1-a0f0-7f8042af693e","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38204.13510798887052059.877668a3-04c3-4622-85fb-40ab679c3781.a6079e80-64d5-48f0-b218-04a3827d7a51","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4215.13510798887052059.69af699c-7850-4542-98d4-9af0ee1a34d1.15dd611c-d522-43a8-8280-de0fa7fa5c77","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4607.13510798887052059.d75998ff-17b8-4c6c-ab93-48e6f7cbd8c0.71ea28ed-98f2-4403-88db-a9b13ac9bfaf","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63988.13510798887052059.ef254f51-55c0-4319-8a19-fe84de635830.4cfc2667-15ca-4b2b-8191-529d45cb96a3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1B372E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["26720RandomSaladGamesLLC.SimpleMinesweeper_kx24dqmazqk8j"],"ContentIds":["701ff180-36f5-d7ca-ca61-3b3855114894"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy the classic game of Minesweeper that used to come with all Windows computers.\r\n\r\nOpen up Simple Minesweeper and start playing the game right away.
