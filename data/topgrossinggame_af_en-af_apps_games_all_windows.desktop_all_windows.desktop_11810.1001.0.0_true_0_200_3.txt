The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins and only begins a new one, and the King, eager to hear the conclusion, postpones her execution once again until the King finally spares her life. So it goes on for 1,001 nights, The Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER TURNED WORRIER:\r\nThis is your journey to the past. You are the worrier of the ‘Arabian Nights’.

This is a shortened version of the “Nature for Tots” app.\r\n \r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of fruits and vegetables, all while learning their names!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThis educational application contains full set of “Fruits” and “Vegetables” flashcards from the “Nature for Kids” application. In addition, it includes the clipped demo sets of the following groups of educational cards: “Berries”, “Flowers”, “Mushrooms”, “Nature” (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), “Seasons”, “Natural phenomena” (rain, rainbow, lightning, etc.).\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSHWN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cars for Kids - truck, tractor, vehicle sounds learning games for toddlers","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40408.9007199266578621.a4937e1d-b8e6-489a-97de-5f64e242ea3a.32ecbe3e-296f-4c03-ab44-637947ee9276","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33226.9007199266578621.1b7f0e94-ba36-4962-a448-6de324267c50.10eaec50-ed28-4f41-b117-0e430201060b","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47076.9007199266578621.401dbc84-c274-4323-ba8f-7533cbd223e6.eb4ae5d3-8ff1-4373-a581-e10fedc00501","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22828.9007199266578621.2c679b4b-24a8-4a0a-859e-efb19a3ec74b.5449397d-c5f2-4c31-98e8-6497857aa62d","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54986.9007199266578621.541bbd7b-5c38-4165-a499-cc00148d85f0.d262576b-122c-435c-8495-96c778317bc7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64926.9007199266578621.bd31768e-df27-4f6f-ae7f-aab17c089580.050849bd-8feb-4d9a-9c78-1a33f08b6c76","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60899.9007199266578621.e7ebab22-0852-4d9d-82e9-665392d476d1.4b5f1a59-b08b-4cb0-bc5e-6ddac31ed165","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32004CLEVERBIT.2897EA8040B5_krxe918j0j7ce"],"ContentIds":["b9f1af58-545b-d8d5-325f-3001676a9888","6a67cd91-4fef-a789-4fb4-b630719c6bc5","5fd408ae-51cb-0364-5b93-fb3831f4417a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“Cars for Kids” is a free learning game for children between the ages of 1 and 4.\r\n\r\nLearning about cars, vehicles and other type of transportation has never been easier.

App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4. Max number of rounds for 'Family-Point' game is 5 while 'Professional' mode game is 8. Player can always 'Give up' game during rounds play then game will declares game winner!\r\n5. App provides user to save up to maximum of 9 game plays. \r\n\r\nNote: I have recently released online version of this game app name 'Carrom online', if you are interested to play online please do try that app.\r\n\r\nKindly rate this app that would encourage me to come with new updates and improvements in future. Report your suggestions and issue to my email address mention in App support contact info.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and looking forward for your feedback & positive reviews!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDXQWR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Panda painting 1","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9001.9007199266693438.f4603c74-903a-4e4e-9e6f-14dd5aa4fc04.1c1d1169-83b2-4ea1-bbfe-1a48e8a35623","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["6E921299.Pandapainting1_qya02bbca3nca"],"ContentIds":["0b81c560-d7d0-09c2-474f-4529c13967ba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Three to four months after birth, the baby starts to feel the different colors.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber.

In each game the dealer calls two friend cards with the sequence numbers that they appears in the game. The players who play the friend cards with the matching sequence will be the friends of the dealer.\r\n\r\nEach game is played with 6 players and 4 French deck of cards, and each player receives 35 cards at the game start. There is 6 remaining cards in the base.\r\n\r\nIn a game, players pre-bid for trump suites using bid cards. After the trump suite is decided, the dealer claims the 6 base cards and swaps 6 cards from hand back to the base. Then players bid again for trump suite and at the same time claims the base cards and swap 6 cards from hand with the base. \r\n\r\nAfter the bidding process is complete, the dealer calls two friend cards with their appearing sequences. Then the players start to play cards in counter-clock order starting with the dealer for the first round. The winner of each round starts play for the next round. Cards of 5, 10, and K are point cards and the winner of each round takes all the points played in the round. After all cards are played and the two friends are identified, all points of opponent players are added up to get total opponent points. If the friend card appears in the base, whoever last swapped to the base is the friend. The points from the base is multipled by certain factors, which is at least 2 times, and are calculated under the winner of the last round.\r\n\r\nTo determine game results:\r\nTotal opponent points < 160: Dealer side won. For each another 80 points less, the dealer side advances one more level.\r\nTotal opponent points >= 160: Opponent side won. For each another 80 points, the opponent side advances one more level.\r\n\r\nIf the opponent side wins, the next opponent player counter-clockwise from the dealer is the next dealer, with the next game to be played under whatever level he is at.\r\n\r\nThe start player can play any valid pattern (e.g. A, AA, AAA, AAKK, or AAAKKKQQQ), or any combination of patterns as long as no other players reject any pattern of the combos. For example, the start player plays AKK, but another player has a AA pair of the same suite, then the KK pair is rejected and the start player is fined for 20 pt.\r\n\r\nAll pursuant players must first follow with cards that best match the played cards of the start player. If the number of identical cards that the player has is more than the number of identical cards played by the start player, these cards are considered exempt and do not have to follow the best match rule (e.g. the start player plays AA, then the following player do not need to break KKK from hand to best match AA, however he must play KK that is the only pair he has).\r\n\r\nSuite Marks and Bidding Rules\r\nThe suites are of different marks, with diamond the lowest, club the next, then heart, then spade, and then black joker and red joker. However to bid with jokers, you must have at least 3 of the same joker cards.\r\n\r\nGame States\r\n\r\nOpenBid/PreBid/SwapBid\r\nPlayers bid in round-table fashion using bid cards. Bid cards are all jokers plus the level cards of the current dealer.\r\nOpenBid state applies only to the first game, in which all players bid for the dealer seat. The first bidder can bid with one card or any number of cards, and any next bidder must bid with more number of cards than the last bidder, regardless of suite marks.\r\nPreBid state applies to all games except the first, before the dealer claims the base cards, in which all players bid for trump suite. The first bidder can bid with one card or any number of cards, and any next bidder must bid with at least 2, and the same or more number of cards then the last bidder. If bid cards must be of higher marks if the number of cards are the same as the last bidder. \r\nBid state applies to all games including the first, after the dealer claims and buries the base cards, in which all players bid for trump suite AND swap 6 cards with the base.\r\nAny any time in the three bidding states, players must use at least three joker cards to bid.\r\nThe suites are of different marks, with diamond the lowest, club the next, then heart, then spade, and then black joker and red joker. However to bid with jokers, you must have at least 3 of the same joker cards.\r\n\r\nSwapping\r\nEither dealer or the current bidder swaps 6 cards from hand and place them into the base.\r\n\r\nCalling\r\nDealer calls 2 friend cards, with their appearing sequences. The dealer can call any card except trump cards.\r\n\r\nPlaying\r\nAll players dispense cards with the dealer starting in the first round.\r\n\r\nPlayer States:\r\nD: Dealer\r\nF: Friend\r\nO: Opponent\r\nS: Swapped\r\nL: Last swapped (who owns the base cards)\r\n\r\nCard Value\r\nIn each suite, the card denomination decides its value, with Ace being the highest, King the second, then Q, J, 10, and rest of the digits with 2 the lowest. K, 10, 5 are point cards, as K and 10 both represent 10 points and 5 for 5 points.\r\n\r\nTrump suite\r\nThe suite of the last bidder is the trump suite. Jokers and all cards with the same rank as the current level are always considered trump suite cards (hardcore trump cards), which are the only trump suite cards if the trump suite is Joker. The other cards of the same suite as the trump suite are softcore trump cards. The level card of the same suite as the trump suite is of higher value as the level cards of other suites, but all of them are of lower values than the Jokers. All level cards are of the same value if the trump suite is Joker. Red Joker is of the highest value, and black Joker is the second highest. The level cards of suites other than the trump suites are continuous with the highest value softcore trump cards.\r\n\r\nCard Patterns\r\nValid patterns include single card, any number of identical cards of the same rank and color (e.g. 4 cards of Ace Club), or tractors, which are comprised of the same number of cards of continuous ranks (e.g. 2 cards each of Ace and King Heart). However special rules apply to the current level cards, the ranks just over and below the rank of the current level are considered continuous (e.g. if the current level is 4, 5 Club and 3 Club are considered to be continuous). \r\n\r\nPower Combo\r\n4 or more cards of the same rank and suite are power combo that can beat other combo with the same number of total cards (e.g. 3333 beats AAKK or AKKK of the same suite). Such power combo of trump suite can also beats other combo of other non-trump suites.\r\n\r\nTractors\r\nA tractor is the combo of the same number of cards of continuous ranks. E.g. when the current level is 4 Heart, all following are valid tractors: {Red Joker x 2, Black Joker x 2}, {Black Joker x 3, 4 Heart x 3}, {4 Heart x 2, 4 Diamond x 2}, {4 Spade x 4, A Heart x 4}, {Q Heart x 2, J Heart x 2, 10 Heart x 2}, and {5 Heart x 2, 3 Heart x 2}.\r\n\r\nPlay Strategy\r\nDuring each play, the player must assess the current game condition, and side with the strongest players or potential strong players if possible. The goal is to advance to higher levels ahead of everybody else.

However, if you don't have a touchscreen, using a mouse or the keyboard is just as much fun.\r\n\r\nIf solving the mazes at your own pace just isn't challenging enough, tap on Speed Test to see how fast you really are. You will then be able to select the Maze Pack and maze that you would like to solve. Displayed above the maze you will see a timer keeping track of every second it takes you to complete each level. Once completed the game will automatically keep track of your best times. You can always reset the maze and try to beat your record.\r\n\r\nIf you want to increase the difficulty even further, in the settings menu you now have the option to add in your own personal background images from any folder on your computer.\r\n\r\nPlay thousands of mazes for free!

All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X6T9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 3 Standard Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4458.13510798887550312.1152921504704380324.3a10922a-e559-46bf-8fb4-a273279585b6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15767.13510798887550312.1152921504704377460.e0e88452-19d8-488c-bd67-b1e62c14728c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58425.13510798887550312.1152921504704377148.5ba983ef-4617-4dec-962c-03bd855030ba","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$39.99⁺","Price":39.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THIS IS YOUR HORIZON\r\nYou’re in charge of the Horizon Festival.
