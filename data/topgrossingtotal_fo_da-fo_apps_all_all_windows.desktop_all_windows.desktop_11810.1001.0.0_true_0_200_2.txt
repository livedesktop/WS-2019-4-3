powerful is your computer? Test it with Cinebench!\r\n\r\nCinebench leverages the same powerful 3D engine found in the award-winning animation software Cinema 4D Release 20 to accurately evaluate CPU rendering performance capabilities across various systems and platforms. \r\n\r\nFor over a decade, Cinebench has been a popular tool to evaluate hardware performance. Cinebench scores are used by system administrators to help make purchase decisions, journalists to review hardware, hardware manufacturers to optimize their latest products, as well as computer owners to evaluate their individual system. \r\n\r\nImprovements to Cinebench Release 20 reflect the overall advancements to CPU and rendering technology in recent years, providing a more accurate measurement of Cinema 4D's ability to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and modern processor features available to the average user.\r\n\r\nCinebench R20 FAQs:\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 uses a much larger and more complex test scene than R15 requiring about 8x the computational power needed to render it. The test also requires about 4x the memory. Therefore R15 and R20 results cannot be compared.\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 and Cinema 4D R20 incorporate the latest rendering architectures, including integration of Intel’s Embree raytracing technology and advanced features on modern CPUs from AMD and Intel that allow users to render the same scene on the same hardware twice as fast as previously. \r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 provides improved benchmark accuracy for current and next generation CPUs to test if a machine runs stable on a high CPU load, if the cooling solution of a desktop or notebook is sufficient for longer running tasks to deliver the full potential of the CPU, and if a machine is able to handle demanding real-life 3D tasks.\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 does not test GPU performance.\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 will not launch on unsupported processors. On systems lacking sufficient RAM to load the test scene, a warning will be displayed and the CPU benchmark will not be executed.\r\n\r\n•\tBackground tasks can significantly influence measurement and create diverse results. It's always a good idea to shut down all running programs and disable any virus checking or disk indexing, but it's impossible to eliminate all background processes. Modern operating systems perform various background tasks that cannot or should not be disabled, even though they could have a minor influence on the results.\r\n\r\n•\tTest results can vary slightly because it's impossible to disable every background task of the operating system. These tasks are one factor that may have a slight influence on measurements. Also, modern computers and graphics cards dynamically adjust clock speeds based on environmental conditions like power and temperature. For instance, processors will reduce clock speed when running too hot to allow for cooling and prevent damage. With many modern processors the reverse is also true. They are able to overclock themselves when the temperature is low enough. So, a system freshly started in a relatively cool environment will typically run faster than the same system that has been performing benchmarks for several hours in a heated office.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

What time does it usually get going each day? How hard did it blow when that front moved through last night?  What parts of the bay have the most wind? Should I have taken today off to go sailing?  If you sail, you want answers to these questions and YachtWinds puts you in the know. \r\n\r\nWhat is going on in the Caribbean today? What about that hurricane that is threating to come up the coast? If you think you had your nose glued to your computer screen last hurricane season, just wait till you get YachtWinds. \r\n\r\nYachtWinds displays the location of NOAH weather stations on a Bing Map. Mostly these are buoys out on the water. But some stations are on land near the water, on lighthouses, towers, platforms, etc. In some cases we provide a picture of the station. \r\n\r\nThe stations are indicated by diamonds on the map. Yellow diamonds indicate stations that we have tested and at that time were producing the data YachtWinds uses and in a format YachtWinds understands. Gray diamonds indicate stations that NOAA said were not producing data when we checked. They may be producing data now (sometimes stations break down and then get fixed). Blue diamonds represent stations that NOAA indicated were good but we could not use for some reason. For example BHBM3 in Boston harbor is producing data but not wind data. When a station is not marked as good (yellow) the reason is shown in the lower left of the screen. Even when a station is not yellow you can usually get the station page and weather forecast. \r\n\r\nWhen you tap or click a station it becomes selected and is shown larger on the screen. The graph updates with the data from that station and the station properties are shown in the lower left. \r\n\r\nMost stations have a web page with additional data.  You can access that using the Station Page button at the upper left of the screen. There is also a button to obtain a weather forecast for the area around the station. \r\n\r\nThe last station you visit will become the Live Tile for the application on the Windows Start Screen. That allows you to get the graph for that station without even opening the app. \r\n\r\nCheck YachtWinds.com for more information and refer questions and comments to

As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again.

Pyramid Solitaire is played with a 52-card deck. First, 28 cards are dealt into a pyramid, starting with one card at the top. The pyramid has 7 rows, and the number of cards equals the row position. Each card covers the one on its upper left and upper right (if there are cards in those places). The remaining 24 cards are put in the draw pile. It is possible to put the top card from the draw pile to the discard pile(s), but not backwards. Only the top card of each pile and the exposed cards in the pyramid may be used to make matches. The remaining cards are placed to the side face down. This is the Stock. \r\n\r\nTo play, pairs of exposed cards can be removed to the Foundation if their values total 13. Aces count as 1, Jacks – 11, Queens – 12. Kings count as 13 and can be removed on their own. All other cards count at their face value. Cards must not be covered. Thus when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed. While playing \"Temp Store\" mode, one card at a time however can be moved to temporary card store (next to stock) to increase your options. You may draw cards from the Stock one at a time and match it with any exposed card. \r\n\r\nEach time the set is removed the score is increased. Once pyramid is cleared extra bonus is awarded. The bonus is increased if all the cards were discarded. The score is proportional to the number of consecutive won games and/or game level .","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLXMP","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire Pack (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18834.9007199266438312.c9bdfc2d-7f13-40ca-9f66-b6672cb540af.e9a3de9f-194f-4bc2-a978-9bb96103a621","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51385.9007199266438312.be03de5f-a069-4a91-852a-0bcb7829c3f9.9b0ae5ec-a49d-41ab-adb8-76b45f9533bb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SolitairePackFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["976ca466-abff-e391-8051-f18b04a71411","14a6f70a-f32c-ba4b-9428-5dd35bef0a9e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobil","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Back in 1990s inclusion of Solitaire (Klondike) and Minesweeper in Windows has resulted in billions of hours of lost productivity over the years.

As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.

Edit. Share. Smile. The free Adobe Photoshop Express app provides photo magic at your fingertips. \r\n\r\nJoin millions of creative folks who trust and use Adobe Photoshop Express for fast, powerful, and easy editing. This is the one-stop shop for your quick and fabulous photo editing needs.\r\n\r\nUse Adobe Photoshop Express to create better looking pictures. Use slide bar adjustments or automatic one-touch fixes to achieve great results. If you’re new to the app, here are few ways to improve your photos:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCING NEW LOOKS AND BORDERS:\r\n\r\nCREATIVE LOOKS:\r\n\r\n* Now choose from more than 45 eye-catching effects called Looks! Control the intensity of Looks with a simple slider. Different categories of Looks like Black and White, Portrait, Nature, Pop Color, and Duo Tones help to get you the right effect to apply.\r\nBORDERS:\r\n\r\n* Use our newly added Borders to add a distinctive personal touch to your photos with 30+ borders and frames. Express yourself!\r\nEDIT PHOTOS:\r\n\r\n* Quickly open photos from the device.\r\n* Snap pictures from right within the app.\r\n* Edit photos to their possible best. An easy to use interface provides seamless switching between various edits.\r\n* The comprehensive photo editor allows you to polish your photos so that you can turn your imagination to reality.\r\n\r\nCROP:\r\n\r\n* Fix photos fast — crop, straighten, rotate clockwise and anticlockwise, flip horizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\n* Crop also provides easy one-touch default aspect ratios.\r\n\r\nCORRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nMake your photos pop with simple sliders:\r\n\r\n* Control and set contrast, clarity, saturation, vibrance, dehaze\r\nUse these controls in your photos to produce stunning results. \r\nContrast is an attention-grabbing control that can turn your ordinary photo into a dazzling masterpiece.\r\nAdjust the color saturation using the Vibrance and Saturation controls.\r\nAdjust clarity slider to reveal more texture and detail in your photos.\r\nUse the Dehaze slider to add or remove haze from your photo.\r\n\r\n* Exposure, highlights, shadows, blacks and whites\r\nYou can fine-tune the photo’s exposure setting using the Exposure adjustment controls. Highlights and Shadows are the best way to optimize your photo’s exposure in highlights, midtones, and shadows, without compromising on other areas of tonality.\r\nUse Blacks and Whites to set black point and white point of the photo. This makes colors appear completely black or white.\r\n\r\n* Temperature and Tint\r\nUse Temperature and Tint controls to introduce warmth or coldness to your photo. You can also control the amount of green and red tones in your photo.\r\nUse the Temperature slider controls to increase or decrease the amount of orange or blue tone. Increasing the amount of orange introduces warmth to your photo. Increasing the amount of blue introduces coldness to your photo.\r\nUse the Tint slider control to add more red or green tone to your photo. Auto White-Balance does this automatically for you.\r\n\r\n* Details\r\nUse Sharpen, Reduce Luminance Noise, and Reduce Color Noise to make photos look more beautiful and minimize unwanted grain and speckling in your photos.\r\n\r\n* Split Tone\r\nStylize your photos through color tints in the highlights and shadows.\r\n\r\n* Blur\r\nUse the Blur effect to give your images an enhanced, surreal effect.\r\n\r\n* Fade\r\nBlend images with the background using the new “Fade” effect and give a matte feel to your photos.\r\n\r\n*Vignette Effect\r\nAdd a sentimental feeling or evoke nostalgia to your images using the Vignette effect.\r\n\r\nSPOT HEAL\r\n* Removing spots or blemishes have never been so easy! Remove pimples, scars, dirt and dust from your photos with one touch.\r\n\r\nREMOVE RED EYE AND FIX PET EYE:\r\n\r\n* Just a tap is required to remove red-eye of people or pets in photos.\r\nYou can use the Red Eye tool to reduce the red eyes in the subjects of your photo. This desaturates the red pixels within the target area and reduces the effect.\r\n\r\nAUTO FIX: \r\n\r\n* Edit your photos with a one-touch auto adjustment.\r\n\r\nRAW PHOTO SUPPORT:\r\n*Photoshop Express supports the following file formats:\r\n• Photo: JPG, PNG\r\n• Raw files: arw (SONY), cr2 (CANON), crw (CANON), dng, erf (EPSON), raf (FUJI), 3fr and fff (HASSELBLAD), dcr (KODAK), mrw (KONICA), mos (LEAF), rwl (LEICA), nef and nrw (NIKON), orf (OLYMPUS), rw2 (PANASONIC), pef (PENTAX), srw (SAMSUNG.\r\nPRINT FEATURE: \r\n* Print the edited photos directly using your Windows device.\r\nSTORE AND SHARE:\r\n\r\n* Your original photo is not lost during editing.

players compete to get all their 15 pieces off the board before the opponent. Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    -
