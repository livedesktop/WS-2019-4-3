Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\r\n\r\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFree.\r\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\r\nFor users by users.\r\n\r\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\r\n\r\nProject change log:\r\nhttps://github.com/nikrolls/uBlock-Edge/releases\r\n\r\nContributors @ Github:\r\nhttps://github.com/nikrolls/uBlock-Edge/graphs/contributors\r\n\r\nContributors @ Crowdin:\r\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4N4N3","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Translator For Microsoft Edge","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40812.13510798887453132.b047073e-fa5f-4065-a225-8a2d27fef351.d1476971-a982-4b31-bf35-4c2e7341d1df","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54132.13510798887453132.0ffc6a8c-99ed-4543-82fd-973d490242c6.51de9596-23da-4a43-97c5-f937e45f4a8c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.TranslatorforMicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["94b2209e-33bf-d07a-d72c-4dccbd52ec5e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"With Translator for Microsoft Edge, you can translate foreign language webpages and text selections for 60+ languages.

Transactions on the Monero blockchain cannot be linked to a particular user or real-world identity.\r\n\r\nMonero is fungible because it is private by default.

Originally inspired by teachers for the Design and Technology classroom, it evolved to an award winning product which covers from Structures to Mechanisms, Renewable energy and even Robotics Control.  The patented geometry of the ENGINO components allows connectivity to all directions of the 3D space with a simple snap-fit method, making it very easy even for children at the age of Primary Schools to build complex models. The 3D model viewer application has been created to allow easy access to new models developed by the ENGINO team and gradually the users themselves. All ENGINO sets have printed step by step instructions for the main models but many additional models can be created. With the new generation of technology where smart phones and tablets have become a part of every-day life, it is essential to enable the users to see new model ideas on these devices. The model viewer has an extensive library of models, continually updated, from cars to motorbikes, planes, helicopters, trucks, cranes and many more! The user can select which model to view and once this is loaded to the application, then the user can rotate the model to see it from various angles, he can zoom in to observe connecting details and most importantly he can explode the model and see how each part connects to the other one.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MXGJ2MC56N8","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Penguin Papas","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21812.13890630939913415.89aa9b68-8373-470e-aa32-7034101bdaf0.e8e0cd3a-c84a-42db-8df2-b41b203ed151","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.PenguinPapas_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["f1d69584-eef6-2b0d-477f-3a5868beb776"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Dividing their time between land and sea, penguins are some of the most involved animal parents.

The area calculator has a unique feature that allows you to set the drawing scale of any image before drawing the perimeter of the shape. Irregular area’s containing angles or curves are therefore easily calculated without complex geometry math.\r\n\r\n• Free trial\r\n\r\n• Search map for an address or longitude and latitude coordinates\r\n\r\n• Upload any .png .jpg .gif or .pdf image and set drawing scale\r\n\r\n• Draw perimeter. Adjust vertices manually or input precise line lengths\r\n\r\n• Multiple Drawing layers with Area sum function\r\n\r\n* Also available as a Web & Mobile App from SketchAndCalc.com\r\n\r\nSimply put, if you have an image you can upload, or a maps address to search, you can calculate the irregular area of the shape regardless of how complex it is just by drawing around the perimeter of the area.  The calculator can even sum multiple area calculations together by way of drawing layers. After the first area has been calculated, a new drawing layer can be added, allowing for an unlimited number of area calculations to be performed. \r\n\r\nResults of the area calculator are displayed in imperial and metric systems, increasing the calculator's utility and removing the need to convert between different square area measurements. This, alongside the calculators precise drawing tools and magnification, ensures that irregular area’s of every size are calculated accurately.\r\n\r\nThe area calculator can also accommodate regular polygon shapes with fixed angles and precise line lengths. The constrained drawing tool snaps to common angles, and line lengths can be manually edited using the keyboard, helpful if your irregular area has a straight side or length. And no irregular area calculator would be complete without a curve drawing tool for odd shapes, another unique feature of SketchAndCalc™.\r\n\r\nWhilst some area calculator apps allow map searching of address, SketchAndCalc™ takes it a step further to support searching of longitude and latitude coordinates. So whether your area is on agricultural land or sea, you’ll spend less time searching and more time calculating your irregular area.\r\n\r\nSketchAndCalc™ has universal utility across many industries, gardeners, building contractors, surveyors or home improvement enthusiasts looking for a floorplan calculator, landscaping calculator, or land area calculator will find their needs met. However, aside from these common uses, many users in the education, medical, science and research fields need a way to find the area of irregular shapes such as cell membranes, or other odd shapes found in biology.\r\n\r\nVisit www.SketchAndCalc.com to learn more","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N487GM876Q7","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Zip Unlock - Unpack RAR, open zip, 7zip, gzip","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43558.13987557732713340.36f67ff8-cee1-4624-9080-260abc821a2b.687403eb-d051-4391-832c-d6f3ce171cf3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20110.13987557732713340.689892d0-23ee-4b06-949f-7840bf54f618.d664e3cc-45ee-4a74-a45d-5af2aba11862","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45078.13987557732713340.b57bb2d7-fa53-46db-ace8-4d03e4d3e4e1.19111e7e-dcfb-44d6-a8b6-26146cc46914","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43015.13987557732713340.3432f181-1009-46c1-9cfc-68e2eb7d62d3.dbce131d-625f-42fc-9ebe-53f794a70598","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42710.13987557732713340.6b1d392d-bf99-4c44-9f46-c9ea4b7f56be.10c95908-ef18-4974-8023-2f6fe9712a86","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6275.13987557732713340.7bc1817b-496f-4623-af50-810ffc1e5483.f5445511-9710-43db-a7b4-b0547fd1a092","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31242.13987557732713340.7c94efdf-3dc0-4d1c-b597-5f473066846a.78ebe850-1130-4f19-9145-7c753100eb20","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38906.13987557732713340.3d71c7c4-9ce4-4b58-9593-252072b88b79.20284ef9-a0f1-4cdf-ac27-9afd6d449054","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45441.13987557732713340.bfd5e563-81b2-4552-a716-cf8e15713fa1.36255c4e-80eb-434c-9f64-f27e49f5ac93","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["33865VideoStudio.ZipUnlock-UnpackRARopenzip7zipgzi_j9hpnndqvt73r"],"ContentIds":["f7d637f2-243e-b19e-79b6-dd6a146553b1","ab85916b-94e3-0a83-fd57-395b79d1f099"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Now unzip all types of archive files viz.

Contains typing games.\r\n\r\nTyping Fingers uses a completely new approach to teach the efficient touch-typing (ten-fingers) system. It makes typing fun, is interactive and works with modern technologies and a new teaching method. The beautiful design and peaceful music create an amazing atmosphere that allows everybody, including children, to improve their typing skills and get TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA after  successful completion of all levels.\r\n\r\n*** SYMMETRIC SUPER LEARNING ***\r\nTyping Fingers uses a modern teaching approach based on brain analysis. The SYMETRIC method helps to activate both  brain hemispheres equally in the process of learning and playing the game. The user maps the keyboard symmetrically and symmetrical patterns are repeated again and again during the whole game.\r\n\r\n*** GET A TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA *** \r\nWin the game and get Foriero's Typing Fingers diploma! You can get exactly the same diploma as you see on the screen shots except with your name and date of game completion. Just print it and stick it on the wall and everybody, even you, will be proud that you have successfully completed TYPING FINGERS.\r\n\r\n*** 32 LEVELS WITH INTERACTIVE TUTOR ***\r\n(In-App Purchase is required for 31 of levels) \r\nIn all the 32 lessons a \"Tutor\" called \"Dennis\" will help you to learn which fingers are for striking which keys. The levels are built up gradually, so you learn how to use your keyboard in a fun and easy way.\r\n\r\n*** LEARNING AND PLAYING MODE ***\r\nEach lesson is divided into two parts. The first one is for learning purposes. In this part Dennis helps you to memorize letters and symbols and to practise the correct motion.\r\n\r\nThe second part is a game and you have \"ONLY\" three lives to beat the level. Work diligently, ardently and persistently and you´ll get it!\r\n\r\n*** WRITE US ***\r\nIf you have any ideas or notions or just feelings on how to improve this\r\napp you can always press the WRITE US button in the game and send us your feedback and wishes. We will be very glad to incorporate all your input into a new version.\r\n\r\nThank you","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NZL3","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Workout Training","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55145.13510798887483700.f131aa42-cb49-4c48-8c9b-d1fc9f6dfb0e.41c9d8db-2d24-4f08-bc46-8600149fe1cd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28419.13510798887483700.ae27b751-d6fe-4a11-bf4e-8f69ce8cec43.3bc51e0c-0d76-4e4d-af5c-1a745920cba3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55145.13510798887483700.f131aa42-cb49-4c48-8c9b-d1fc9f6dfb0e.41c9d8db-2d24-4f08-bc46-8600149fe1cd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["47414BigStudio.WorkoutTraining_6z6eaykprsxy8"],"ContentIds":["70d17c04-c7fc-f1b9-9274-c6a9501db2b7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Workout Training is a great 10 to 30 minute daily workout routine for men and women that steps you through some of the best exercises you can do in the comfort of your own home.\r\nFEATURES: \r\n- 10 to 30 minute full body workouts\r\n- 80 exercises\r\n- 100+ diet recipes\r\n- 7 Minute Workout\r\n- Video showing how to do each exercise \r\n- Developed by a certified personal Tranning\r\n- On-screen instructions and timer\r\n\r\nNew Release 3.0 : Add 7 Minute Workout. 12 exercises are performed for 30 seconds, with 10 seconds of transition time between bouts.
